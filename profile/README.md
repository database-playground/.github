# Database Playground

“Database Playground” (資料庫練功房) is a project designed for experimenting with a SQL gamification system.

## Repository

[`app-sf`](https://github.com/database-playground/app-sf) is the main repository for Database Playground.

Components of Database Playground:

- [`sqlrunner-v2`](https://github.com/database-playground/sqlrunner-v2): The SQL runner of Database Playground.

Before choosing Symfony, I experimented with various tech stacks, including:

-  Go Microservices: [`backend-go`](https://github.com/database-playground/backend-go)
-  Rust: [`backend-rs`](https://github.com/database-playground/backend-rs) and [`dbrunner-rs`](https://github.com/database-playground/dbrunner-rs)
